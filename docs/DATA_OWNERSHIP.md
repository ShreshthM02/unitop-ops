# Data Ownership Map

**Purpose:** every important fact about a tour file exists in exactly the places listed here — no more, no less. If you're about to add a feature that reads or writes one of these facts, check here first. If a fact isn't listed here yet, it needs to be added before the feature ships (see "Adding a new fact" at the bottom).

This file is not documentation of "how things currently happen to work." It is a set of decisions. Where two places legitimately hold the same fact, that duplication is deliberate and explained — not accidental drift.

Last verified against live Supabase schema: 2026-07-15.

## How to read this

Each fact has:
- **Canonical owner** — the one table/column that is the real answer, when asked "what is this, actually?"
- **Other holders** — every other place that reads or stores a copy, and whether that copy is:
  - **LIVE** — must always match the owner. If it doesn't, that's a bug.
  - **SNAPSHOT** — deliberately independent once created (a draft, a point-in-time record, a different currency/context). Divergence is expected and fine.

## Tour Value (three real homes, on purpose)

| Holder | Column(s) | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`quotations`** (starred version) | `tour_value`, `confirmed_pax`, `final_price_entries` | **Canonical for "what was agreed"** | Composed from rate lines (pax paying × rate + FOC), captured when a version is marked final. This is *the* answer to "what did we agree with the client." |
| `payments` | `tour_value`, `tour_value_inr`, `roe_used` | SNAPSHOT | Independently entered in the Payment Tracker for reconciliation. Deliberately **not** auto-synced from Quotations — currency, ROE, and manual adjustments can legitimately differ. The Payment Tracker shows a reference banner ("Final quotation agreed: ...") so staff can cross-check by eye, but nothing overwrites the other automatically. |
| `agent_ledger.tour_value` | — | **ORPHANED** | Table has zero rows, zero code references. Not a real holder — see "Orphaned tables" below. |

**Rule going forward:** if Tax Invoice (not yet built) needs a tour value, it pre-fills from `quotations.tour_value` as a starting point, then is independently editable (SNAPSHOT), same pattern as Payments. It must never live-sync from Quotations after the fact.

---

## Pax Count (three real homes)

| Holder | Column(s) | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `queries` | `pax_display`, `pax_exact`, `pax_min`, `pax_max` | SNAPSHOT (early estimate) | The query-stage estimate, often "TBC" until close to departure. Free text (`pax_display`) plus optional exact/range numbers. **There is no bare `pax` field — that name has never existed.** If you write `query.pax` or `q.pax`, it will always be `undefined`. Use `query.paxDisplay`. |
| **`quotations`** (starred version) | `confirmed_pax`, plus the paying/FOC breakdown inside `final_price_entries` | **Canonical once it exists** | The real, confirmed number. Once a final quotation exists, this — not `queries.pax_display` — is the answer to "how many people." |
| `cost_sheets.slabs` | — | Not a count at all | Pricing *tiers* (e.g. "15–19 pax"), used only for rate calculation. Never read as "the pax count" anywhere — if you're tempted to, don't; use `quotations.confirmed_pax` instead. |

**Known gap:** nothing currently pulls `quotations.confirmed_pax` back into `queries.pax_display` for display consistency once a quotation is finalized — a query's own "pax" field can still show the old TBC estimate even after a real number exists elsewhere. Not fixed yet; flagging so it doesn't surprise anyone.

## Route / Itinerary / Hotels (decided plan in progress — see "Document Chain Architecture" below for full execution phases)

| Holder | Column(s) | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`tour_execution`** | `days[].route`, `days[].hotelName`, `days[].rooms` | **Canonical operational record** | Populated only via the Tour File drawer's Info tab (Day-wise Itinerary / Hotels). This is what Movement Chart reads, and what the Tour Facilitator/Local Handler/Transporter columns resolve against. |
| `cost_sheets.days` | — | SNAPSHOT, pre-filled from the owner above | A **pricing draft** — day-by-day cost breakdown for quoting. **Built (2026-07-22, Phase 1): auto-fills `movement`/`hotel` from `tour_execution.days[].route`/`hotelName` at Cost Sheet creation time only** (one-way pre-fill, never a live sync), then independently editable — pricing fields (`mealCost`, `hotelNetPP`, `singleSupp`) have no equivalent in `tour_execution` at all and are pure Cost Sheet content, left blank rather than fabricated. |
| `tour_execution.days` (reverse direction) | `synced_from_cost_sheet_version` | SNAPSHOT, mutually staleness-checked | **Built (2026-07-22).** In real usage Cost Sheet is created first (opens automatically at the "costing" pipeline stage, well before conversion), while `tour_execution`'s Day-wise tabs are gated behind `tourFileId` and don't even exist to edit until conversion — so the Phase 1 direction above rarely has anything to pull from in practice. This is the mirror: at conversion (`handleConvertToCaseFile`), a one-time reverse pre-fill pulls the star-marked (or, absent one, latest) Cost Sheet's `movement`/`hotel` into `tour_execution.days`, recording which version it came from in `synced_from_cost_sheet_version`. After that, `tour_execution` is the live operational record — ops amends it freely, no re-sync forced. The Day-wise Itinerary/Hotels tabs check on open whether a star-marked Cost Sheet version exists that `synced_from_cost_sheet_version` doesn't match, and show a banner + explicit "↻ Sync from Cost Sheet" button if so — never automatic, never silent. Deliberately does **not** flag ops's own direct amendments to `tour_execution` as "stale" against the Cost Sheet's exact content — that divergence is expected and desired once operations begins; only a *newer finalized Cost Sheet version* that hasn't been pulled in triggers the banner. |
| `quotations.itinerary`, `quotations.hotels` | — | SNAPSHOT, pre-filled from Cost Sheet | Client-facing copy for the quotation document. **Decided: auto-pulls from the linked Cost Sheet at Quotation creation time only** (via `costSheetId`), consolidating consecutive same-hotel days into one row with a nights count, and parsing `mealPlan` into per-meal inclusion. Built 2026-07-20 as an explicit "↻ Pull from Cost Sheet" button; auto-fire-on-creation is Phase 3 of the Document Chain plan (not yet built — currently requires the manual button click). |

**The warning banner shown in the Tour File drawer's Itinerary/Hotels tabs** ("Cost Sheet's own day fields are a separate pricing draft and may not automatically match this") describes the *current* unconnected state, not the intended end state — once Phase 1 lands, Cost Sheet starts *from* `tour_execution`'s data rather than from nothing, closing most of the gap this banner exists to warn about. The banner can be reworded or removed once Phase 1 ships; not done yet.

## Document Persistence Status (audited 2026-07-21, Phase 0 completed same day)

Before any auto-pull/sync-awareness mechanism can mean anything, a document needs somewhere real to record what it was pulled from. This was checked directly against each component's actual code, not assumed. **Phase 0 is now complete: all six previously-unpersisted documents have real, versioned save/load, matching Cost Sheet/Quotation's pattern.**

| Document | Persistence | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cost Sheet | ✅ Real, versioned | `saveCostSheetVersion`/`loadCostSheetVersions` — full snapshot per version, `is_final` marking, real history. |
| Quotation | ✅ Real, versioned | `saveQuotationVersion`/`loadQuotationVersions` — mirrors Cost Sheet's pattern exactly. |
| Tour Details (`tour_execution.days`) | ⚠️ Single mutable record | `updateTourExecution` overwrites in place. `query_audit` logs an action label (`"Updated day-wise itinerary"`) on each save, but not a data snapshot — no way to see or restore what it looked like before. Still not full version history; not part of Phase 0 (it's the canonical operational record, not one of the nine chained documents) but worth revisiting later. |
| Brief + Detailed Itinerary (`ItineraryBuilder.jsx`) | ✅ Real, versioned (built 2026-07-21) | `itineraries` table. Brief and Detailed share one table but have **independent version sequences** — saving one never bumps the other's counter, and `markItineraryVersionFinal` is scoped by style for the same reason. Fixed a dead "💾 Save Itinerary" button (no `onClick` at all) in the same pass. |
| Meal Plan (`MealPlanDocument.jsx`) | ✅ Real, versioned (built 2026-07-21) | `meal_plans` table. |
| Exchange Orders (`ExchangeOrderGenerator.jsx`) | ✅ Real, versioned (built 2026-07-21) | `exchange_orders` table. `orders[]` (a list of independent vendor instructions, each with its own `confirmed` flag) versioned as one snapshot per save for consistency with the rest of the chain. |
| Tour Briefing Sheet (`TourBriefingSheet.jsx`) | ✅ Real, versioned (built 2026-07-21) | `tour_briefings` table. Also fixed a real, separate bug found along the way: the component was being passed `vendors={vendors}` (the full, unfiltered vendor list) when it expects a prop called `facilitators` — the Tour Facilitators section had been silently empty. |
| Pro-forma Invoice (`ProformaInvoice.jsx`) | ✅ Real, versioned (built 2026-07-21) | `proforma_invoices` table. Also fixed a real bug: `invoiceNo` defaulted from a `localStorage` counter that never synced across staff/devices — the exact "duplicate invoice numbers across staff" risk the settings migration existed to prevent, which had never actually been wired into this file. Now computed via `nextInvoiceNo()` (already existed in `utils.js`, never used) against every invoice number ever saved, queried globally via `loadExistingInvoiceNumbers` (not scoped to one `query_id`, since invoice numbers must be unique business-wide). Save is guarded against the race condition where a user clicks Save before that async computation resolves. |
| Tax Invoice (`TaxInvoice.jsx`) | ✅ Real, versioned (built 2026-07-21) | `tax_invoices` table. Same invoice-numbering fix as Pro-forma — was defaulting to `` `TAX-2026-${Math.random()...}` ``, a random 3-digit suffix with **zero uniqueness guarantee**, on a document with GST/legal sequential-numbering implications. Also fixed a dead "💾 Save Tax Invoice" footer button (no `onClick` at all). |

**Six of nine documents in the intended chain (Query → Cost Sheet → everything downstream) have no persistence of any kind.** This is Phase 0 of the Document Chain plan below — giving all six the same versioned `saveXVersion`/`loadXVersions` pattern Cost Sheet and Quotation already use — and it comes before any pull/sync work, since sync-awareness has nothing to attach to otherwise.

## Document Chain Architecture (in progress, started 2026-07-21)

The intended data flow for a tour file, end to end:

```
New Query → Tour Details (LIVE identity: group name, destination, tour file ID, pax, nights, dates — read directly from `queries` everywhere, never copied)
        │
        ├─→ Day-wise Itinerary + Day-wise Hotels (`tour_execution.days` — the operational record)
        │         │
        │         ▼
        │   Cost Sheet (SNAPSHOT, pre-filled from tour_execution at creation, then independently priced)
        │         │
        │         ├──→ Quotation, Brief Itinerary, Detailed Itinerary, Meal Plan, Exchange Orders, Tour Briefing Sheet
        │         │      (all SNAPSHOT, pre-filled from Cost Sheet at creation, then independently editable)
        │         │
        │         └──→ (final agreed price, once Quotation is marked final)
        │                    │
        │                    ├──→ Pro-forma Invoice
        │                    └──→ Tax Invoice
```

**Two categories of data, and the rule for each:**
- **LIVE** (identity data — group name, destination, tour file ID, pax, nights, dates, client/agent name): never copied into any downstream document's own state. Always read directly from `queries` on every render. There is nothing to sync because there is only ever one copy.
- **SNAPSHOT** (pricing, wording, day-by-day content, presented amounts): copied from its upstream source **once, automatically, at document creation** — never on a recurring basis, never silently overwriting an existing version. After that first pull, fully independently editable, with its own real version history (Phase 0).

**The pull mechanism (applies uniformly wherever a SNAPSHOT relationship exists):**
1. Auto-fires exactly once, only when the downstream document is being created fresh (zero saved versions exist yet) — safe by construction, since there's nothing yet to overwrite.
2. Every version records which upstream version it was pulled from (e.g. a Quotation version stores `cost_sheet_id` + the Cost Sheet version number at pull time).
3. If the upstream document gets a newer saved version afterward, downstream shows a visible "Cost Sheet updated to vN — pull latest?" banner. Re-pulling after that point is always an explicit, manual action — never automatic — so a salesperson's negotiated pricing or a briefing sheet someone's already annotated can never be silently destroyed by an upstream edit.
4. Missing upstream fields are left blank downstream, not filled with placeholder/generic content — a pull is a starting point, not a requirement to fabricate data that doesn't exist yet.

**Shared extraction library (avoids the "fixed once, still broken elsewhere" bug class):** the day-wise itinerary/hotel/meal-plan extraction logic is written once and reused by every document that needs that shape of data (Quotation, Brief/Detailed Itinerary, Meal Plan), rather than reimplemented per document. `calcCostSheetSlabFinalPrice` in `utils.js` (built 2026-07-20) is the first instance of this pattern — a deliberate standalone copy of Cost Sheet's own internal pricing logic, not an import, specifically so Quotation's pull feature doesn't create a dependency on Cost Sheet's internals. If the pricing formula ever changes, both copies need updating together — a documented tradeoff, not an oversight.

**Execution phases:**
- **Phase 0 — Persistence. ✅ Complete (2026-07-21).** All six unpersisted documents now have real, versioned save/load, matching Cost Sheet/Quotation's pattern. Found and fixed three real bugs along the way (not scope creep -- each was directly relevant to giving these documents correct persistence): Itinerary needed independently-scoped version sequences per style (Brief/Detailed), Tour Briefing Sheet's facilitators prop was silently wired to the wrong data, and both invoice documents had genuinely unsafe number generation (a localStorage counter and a random number, respectively) that the persistence work replaced with a real, globally-queried safe sequence.
- **Phase 1 — `tour_execution` → Cost Sheet. ✅ Complete (2026-07-22).** A brand-new Cost Sheet (no saved versions yet) now pre-fills `days[].movement`/`hotel` from `tour_execution.days[].route`/`hotelName` via a new targeted loader (`loadTourExecutionForQuery`), rather than the old generic hardcoded 4-row default. Pricing-only fields (`mealCost`, `hotelNetPP`, `singleSupp`) stay blank -- they have no `tour_execution` equivalent to pre-fill from. Falls back gracefully to the old hardcoded default if `tour_execution` has no days yet. Confirmed one-way and creation-time-only: once a Cost Sheet has any saved version, this never runs again and never touches the draft.
- **Phase 2 — Query → Cost Sheet auto-init. ✅ Complete (2026-07-22).** Day row count matches `query.nights` directly (confirmed against this app's own convention — a real 10-night tour had exactly 10 day rows, not the generic travel-industry "nights+1 days"). Starting slab centers on `query.pax` when it's a confirmed single number (not a TBC range like "15–20") — one slab, e.g. "17 pax + 1 FOC", vehicle defaulting to Mini Bus under 20 pax and Large Coach at or above. Falls back to the old hardcoded defaults (4 days, 5 pax-range slabs) whenever `nights`/`pax` aren't set yet or `pax` is still an unconfirmed range — a single guessed slab would likely be wrong while group size is still TBC.
- **Phase 3 — Cost Sheet → Quotation, upgraded.** The existing manual "↻ Pull from Cost Sheet" button (built 2026-07-20) becomes auto-fire-on-creation, plus the staleness banner from the pull mechanism above.
- **Phase 4 — Replicate to Brief/Detailed Itinerary, Meal Plan.** Reuses the shared extraction library; no new extraction logic needed, only new formatting per document.
- **Phase 5 — Exchange Orders + Tour Briefing Sheet.** Needs one new extraction shape (vendor/logistics grouping by sector) not required by the Phase 4 documents.
- **Phase 6 — Pro-forma + Tax Invoice.** Deliberately last. Pulls a *suggested* starting amount from the final agreed price once a Quotation is marked final, but the actual billed line items never silently recompute — a human confirming what goes on an invoice is intentional, not a gap.

## Vendor Assignments (Transporter / Facilitator / Local Handler)

| Holder | Column(s) | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`vendors`** | `id`, `name`, `type`, `languages`, `areas`, contact fields | **Canonical vendor master data** | One real vendor record per person/company, filtered by `type` in the UI (Transport / Tour Facilitator / Local Handler / Hotel / etc). |
| `tour_execution` | `transporters[]`, `facilitators[]`, `local_handlers[]` | Reference only | Each entry is `{vendorId, sector, notes}` — a pointer into `vendors`, not a copy of vendor data. Clean owner/reference relationship, no duplication risk here. |
| `payment_outgoing.vendor` | — | Free text, NOT a reference | Deliberately not tied to `vendors.id` — outgoing payments can go to non-vendor-master payees (airlines, railways, one-off charges), so a strict FK isn't right here. VendorMaster's "Related Payments" section matches this against vendor name as best-effort, not a guaranteed link — labeled as such in the UI. |

**VendorMaster's "Service History" tab** now reads real assignment history from `tour_execution`, matched strictly by `vendor.id` — this is the correct, reliable signal for "which tours has this vendor actually worked on." It used to be built entirely from `payment_outgoing` name-matching (and that matching was additionally broken by a missing prop — see bugs log), so assigning a facilitator in the Tour File drawer's Info tab never showed up there at all. Fixed 2026-07-16.

---

## Audit Trail

| Holder | Notes |
|---|---|
| **`query_audit`** | Single canonical log for every meaningful action on a tour file. Every persistence function (`saveQueryToDB`, `updateTourExecution`, `updatePayments`, Cost Sheet/Quotation save+final, Services, Document Registry, receipts) logs here via the shared `logAudit` helper. No other table holds a parallel history — if something isn't showing up in Audit, it's a missing `logAudit` call, not a second audit system to check. |

---

## Orphaned tables — dropped 2026-07-17

These existed in Supabase with zero rows and zero code references, confirmed across three separate audits (2026-07-15, 2026-07-16, 2026-07-17) before removal:

- `agent_ledger` (a VIEW)
- `agent_lumpsum_payments`
- `lumpsum_allocations`
- `payments_incoming` *(the near-identical-name hazard vs the real, active `payment_incoming` — the main motivation for dropping rather than just documenting)*
- `facilitators` *(standalone table — superseded by `vendors` filtered by `type = 'Tour Facilitator'`)*

All five are gone. `agent_lumpsum_payments` had a foreign-key dependency from `lumpsum_allocations`, dropped in the correct order rather than via `CASCADE`, to avoid silently removing anything unexpected.

---

## Bugs found and fixed during this audit (2026-07-15)

1. **`vendors.languages` / `vendors.areas` never existed as columns**, despite `VendorMaster.jsx` having fully working UI for them and `saveVendorToDB` always sending them. Every vendor save has been failing outright since the feature was built — confirmed via a live insert test, which errored with `column "languages" of relation "vendors" does not exist`. The `vendors` table had **zero rows, ever**. Fixed by adding the missing columns; verified end-to-end as the anon role.
2. **`queries.source_other`, `queries.travel_date_to`, `queries.internal_correspondent`** — all three are typed into working UI fields but were never included in `buildQuerySavePayload`, so silently never persisted. Same bug class as the earlier `assigned_to` gap. Fixed.
3. **`VendorMaster`'s "Service History" tab had nothing to do with tour assignments.** It was built entirely from `payment_outgoing` entries matched by fuzzy name substring against the vendor's name — meaning assigning a Tour Facilitator/Local Handler/Transporter in the Tour File drawer's Info tab never appeared there, ever. Compounding this: `payments` was declared as a prop in `VendorMaster`'s signature but never actually passed in the render call, so this tab (and "Financial Ledger") had been showing empty results regardless of any real payment data. Fixed by (a) passing the missing prop, and (b) adding a real, `vendor.id`-matched assignment history as the primary content of the tab, with the payment-based data kept as a separate, clearly-labeled secondary section.
4. **`q.pax` / `query.pax` — a field that has never existed — was referenced across 10 different files**: Dashboard, Kanban, All Queries, Tour Files, Payment Tracker, Exchange Order Generator, Proforma Invoice, Tax Invoice, Tour Briefing Sheet, and the Active Pipeline report. Only `paxDisplay` has ever actually held a value. This meant pax count silently showed blank/dash across nearly the entire app, everywhere except the few places that happened to use the correct field name (Movement Chart, built correctly last round). Fixed everywhere it was found; each document generator's own local `pax` form field is now correctly seeded from `paxDisplay` at open time, then remains independently editable within that document (SNAPSHOT, same pattern as everything else).
5. **Confirmed correct, not a bug:** individual per-staff permission overrides (set in User Management) looked suspicious at first — the general `staff` list load deliberately excludes the `permissions` column (bundled in with genuinely sensitive fields like `password_hash` during earlier security hardening). But permission *enforcement* never reads from that list — `currentUser` comes from the `staff_login` RPC, which correctly returns the real `permissions` value from the row directly. Verified by reading the actual RPC function body in Postgres, not just the client code. The UI's own "changes take effect on next login" notice is accurate, not a symptom of a deeper bug.
6. **RLS policies checked for consistency across all 19 tables** — every one has an appropriate anon-access policy; `staff` is correctly read-only-safe-columns for anon, by design. No silent access-denial gaps found.
7. **`document_registry.tour_file_id`** — a real column, available at the call site (`DocRegistryInline` already receives `tourFileId` as a prop), but never threaded through to `saveDocRegistry`. Found by the new schema-completeness test (see below) on its first run. Fixed.

---

## Tour Identity/Display (name, dates, pax shown in Dashboard/Search — eliminated, not documented as a duplicate)

There used to be a second, frozen copy of core tour facts (`name`, `dates`, `pax`, `status`) in a separate `tours` state array, captured once at "Convert to Tour File" time and never updated again. `Dashboard`'s "Tour Calendar" widget and the "Tours On Ground" stat read from it directly; `SmartSearch` searched it as a second, duplicate result type that did nothing when clicked; `GanttView` received it as a prop but never actually used it (dead prop).

**This was not a LIVE/SNAPSHOT split worth keeping — it was pure duplication with no purpose**, so it was removed entirely rather than documented as an intentional pattern. `Dashboard` and `SmartSearch` now derive tour name/dates/pax/status fresh from `queries` on every render, the same way `GanttView` already correctly did. Found 2026-07-17 after a direct user report that Info tab edits weren't reflecting on Dashboard/Tour Calendar. Fixed by deleting the `tours` state, not by adding a sync step — one less place for a fact to drift out of date.

---

## Group / Client Name (a display-priority bug, not a duplication worth keeping)

`queries.group_name` and `queries.client_name` are two separate columns for the same concept: the tour's display name. **`group_name` is the only one with an actual input field anywhere in the app** — `client_name` has never had an editable UI field, but real historical data still holds old values in it (found live: `UTQ-2026-037` has `group_name: "UTT Golden Triangle"` and a stale, unrelated `client_name: "Golden Triangle Tour"`).

Every view fell back with `groupName || clientName` — checking the actual editable field first — **except** Dashboard, GanttView, the drawer's own header, SmartSearch, VendorMaster, VendorLedgerPanel, and `DestinationOverlapView` (dead code), which all checked `clientName || groupName` instead. For any query with a stale `client_name` value, those views would show the old name forever, no matter how many times `group_name` was correctly edited and saved — looking exactly like a persistence failure when the save was actually working the whole time. Found 2026-07-17 via a direct report ("changed tour name still not visible") that survived two earlier, real, but different fixes (the `tours` snapshot and the `finance`-status filter gap).

**Fixed by standardizing `groupName || clientName` everywhere.** Not treating this as an intentional LIVE/SNAPSHOT pair worth keeping distinct — `client_name` has no legitimate independent role right now, it's just an unused column with old data sitting in it. If a genuine "client name distinct from group name" concept is ever wanted, it needs its own editable UI field first, not a silent fallback-order dependency.

---

## Standing safeguard: schema-completeness tests

`src/__tests__/schemaCompleteness.test.jsx` mechanically checks every save function against the live column list for its table — not from memory, but a snapshot captured directly from Supabase. Each test calls the real save function and asserts every real column actually appears as a key in what gets sent to the database. This is the direct fix for the bug class this whole document exists to prevent: a column existing on the live table with a working UI field feeding it, silently dropped because the save function never included that key.

**This is not optional maintenance — it already found a real bug (`document_registry.tour_file_id`) on its first run**, before it could sit undetected the way `vendors.languages`/`assigned_to` did.

**When a migration changes a table's columns, `EXPECTED_COLUMNS` in this test file must be updated in the same change** — same discipline as this document itself. A column intentionally left unused (like `version_name`) gets added to the relevant exclusion list with a one-line reason, not silently ignored.

---

## Adding a new fact — the checklist

Before a new feature persists something new, or reads something that already exists elsewhere:

1. **Who's the canonical owner?** One table/column, not "wherever's convenient."
2. **Does anything else legitimately need a copy?** If yes — LIVE (must always match; needs a real sync mechanism) or SNAPSHOT (independent after creation; needs a reference/cross-check, not a sync)?
3. **Update this file.** A fact that lives in two places without an entry here is exactly how the `assigned_to` and `vendors.languages` bugs happened.
4. **If it's a new column on an existing table:** confirm the migration actually landed on the live schema — don't assume from the code. `information_schema.columns` is the source of truth, not memory of what should have been added.
